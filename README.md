In this task, I worked on Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, which is one of the most crucial steps in data analysis. Raw data often contains noise, missing values, and inconsistent formatting. I cleaned the data by identifying and handling null values using fillna() or dropna(), removed duplicates using .drop_duplicates(), and converted data types when needed. Additionally, I performed categorical data encoding through Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding using tools from sklearn.preprocessing, which made non-numeric data usable in machine learning algorithms. This task reinforced the importance of data integrity and ensured that the dataset was ready for modeling and visualization.
